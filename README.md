# TPS game with Kotlin server
This is a third person shooter game with customizable map and 3D models (school project). Server backend was made with Kotlin (it was quite tough to work with it), the game itself was written using Threejs (it's really similar to my quiz game so uploaded game files are already built). All data is being stored in postgreSQL database.
